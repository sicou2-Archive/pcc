We will write a web app called Learning Log and allows users to log the topics
they are interested in and to make journal entries as the learn about each
topic.
The Learning Log home page will describe the site and invite users to either
register or log in. Once logged in, a user can create new topics, add new
entries, and read and edit existing entries.
