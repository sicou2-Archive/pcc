18-4 Pizzeria: Start a new project called pizzeria with an app called pizzas.
Define a model Pizza with a field called name, which will hold name values,
such as Hawaiian and Meat Lovers. Define a model called Topping with fields
called pizza and name. The pizza field should be a foreign key to Pizza, and
name should be able to hold values such as pineapple, Canadian bacon, and
sausage.
Register both models with the admin site, and use the site to enter some pizza
names and toppings. Use the shell to explore the data you entered.
