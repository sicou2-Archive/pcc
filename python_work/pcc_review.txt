        Ch 2: Variables and Simple Data Types
    Variables
variable = "Thing assigning to variable."
variable = "Thing that replaces old value in variable"
Variables can have letters, numbers, and _
    Can only start with letter or _; No spaces; do not use Python
    keywords; should be short and descriptive without being overly
    short or descriptive; be careful with lower-case L and number 1 or 
    capital o or number 0
Can think of variables as boxes, though it can be better to think of
 them as labels

    Strings
String is series of characters, usually to be displayed to a user, 
    surrounded by ' ', or " "
.title() variable.title() Capitalize words in string
.lower() variable.lower() lower-case words in string
.upper() variable.upper() upper-case words in string
Variables in strings. Two methods, format string and .format();
    f'thing {variable}'; 'string {}  {}'.format(var_1, var_2);
    I do know that there is something to do with % to format strings, 
    though I am not super sure how to use that. I think it is more of 
    a Python 'pre 3.6' thing. 
Can do formating to a string and then assign that to a variable
Can use escape \n (newline) and \t (tab) to add white space to a string
.rstrip() variable_string.rstrip() strip all white space to the right 
    of the string permanently
