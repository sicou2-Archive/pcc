        Ch 2: Variables and Simple Data Types
    Variables
variable = "Thing assigning to variable."
variable = "Thing that replaces old value in variable"
Variables can have letters, numbers, and _
    Can only start with letter or _; No spaces; do not use Python
    keywords; should be short and descriptive without being overly
    short or descriptive; be careful with lower-case L and number 1 or 
    capital o or number 0
Can think of variables as boxes, though it can be better to think of
 them as labels

    Strings
String is series of characters, usually to be displayed to a user, 
    surrounded by ' ', or " "
.title() variable.title() Capitalize words in string
.lower() variable.lower() lower-case words in string
.upper() variable.upper() upper-case words in string
Variables in strings. Two methods, format string and .format();
    f'thing {variable}'; 'string {}  {}'.format(var_1, var_2);
    I do know that there is something to do with % to format strings, 
    though I am not super sure how to use that. I think it is more of 
    a Python 'pre 3.6' thing. 
Can do formating to a string and then assign that to a variable
Can use escape \n (newline) and \t (tab) to add white space to a string
.rstrip() variable_string.rstrip() strip all white space to the right 
    of the string permanently 
Be careful about extra whitespace, it can cause problems
.lstrip() strip all white space to the left of the string permanently 
.strip() strip all white space on both sided of the string permanently
Be careful when using single or double quotes inside of strings. Make 
    sure to mix when possible and to use \' \" when needed. 

    Numbers
+ add; - subtract; * multiply; / divide; ** exponents, 
% modulus (remainder); // floor divide (whole number only)
2 + 3*4 is one way to help make readability better by showing order of 
    operations a little more clearly. 
    
    Floats
once a number becomes a float it stays what way until forced to do 
    otherwise. 
Calling a float makes a float, float(), or dividing (/). 
Be careful due to how computers deal with floats, you can sometimes get
    a crazy amount of decimal places. 
Python defaults to a float in any operation that uses a float regardless
    of what it evaluates to. 
You can use underscored to make large numbers more readable, however 
    Python ignores them 1_000_000 or 1_00_00_00
It is possible to assign multiple variables values on a single line of 
    code; x, y, z = 1, 3, 5 
Python does not have explicit constants, however you can indicate that
something is a constant by using ALL_CAPS_IN_THE_VARIABLE_NAME = 4000
    
    Comments
#Comments are notes to yourself and others
#Can be used as TODO, or explane things, or reminders, or whatever you
    #want them to be used for. 
#There are no block comments in Python
#Good comments are there to remind you what something does after you 
    #have to leave it and come back to it later. Just enough to jog your
    # or someone elses memory. 
#If something took you more than one or two stabs to figure out how to 
    #get something working it is probably a good idea to comment on it.

        Ch 3: Introducing Lists
    What Is a List?
A list is a data structure that is collection of items in a particular 
    order
    As opposed to a dict, tuple, or set (there are others too)
in Python [] square brackets indicate a list
    a_list = [1, 2, 'dog', True, 'happy']
You can access an element in a list by using its index number, (starting
    at 0 (zero))
Index positions start at 0 
Be wary of off by one errors
Can use indexed values from a list f'String {variable[0]}'

    Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements
Can modify by directly assigning the new value to the variable index
    variable[3] = 'tommy'
Can add to a list in a few ways
    variable_list.append('sam') adds 'sam' to the end of the list
    variable_list[3].insert('jim') adds 'jim' at index value 3 moving
        everything after index 3 down one index
Can also remove items from a list:
    del variable_list[1] will remove the item from index 1
    variable_list.pop() will remove the last item in the list.
        you can also assign this popped item to another variable
    popped = variable_list.pop()
    variable_list.remove('item to be removed') will remove the first
    instance of 'item to be removed' moving every item after up one 
    index number

    Organizing a List
variable.sort() will permanently sory a list alphabetically
can also do variable.sort(reverse=True) to reverse alphabetize a list
    permenantly
I know this comes up later when talking about slicing a list, but you
cannot just assign a list to another variable to preserve the original 
order of that list. 
    If you do not slice and just list = original_list, when you sort
        list, original_list will be sorted as well. You must slice 
        the list and the "re-slice" the list in order to return an 
        original order
            You can so this by new_list = old_list[:]
A temporart sorting of a list can be done with the sorted() function
sorted(list) will return the list temporarilly sorted alphabetically.
NOTE: Python does something weird with UPPER and lower case letters
    when sorting them. Be careful when dealing with this so you do not 
    get unexpected behaviors. 
    sorted(list, reverse=True) will also work for sorted. 
It seems like you can not print(list.sort()) but you *CAN* 
print(sorted(list))
list.reverse() can be used to simply reverse the current list order
    permanently, however this is not so big of a deal since you can 
    list.reverse() a second time to get back to your first order. 
You can len(list_variable) to get the int (starting at 1)of indexes in 
    the list

    Avoiding Index Errors When Working with Lists
Be aware of off-by-one errors
Remember list[-1] to get the last item in a list. This always works 
    except for when the list is empty


        Ch 4: Working with Lists
    Looping Through an Entire List
Looping is useful, huh, who would have thought. 
list_of_n_length
for num in list:
    print(num)
I might be wrong, but for-loops need to be indexable, otherwise it 
    cannot count where it is in the loop.
If possible make the "num" part of the loop at least a little 
    descriptive even if it is only a temp variable. Where "num" is the 
    index position variable at that index, in the list being looped. 
You can do almost anything from within a loop. print(f"{num.title()})")
Just remember that it will do this every time it goes through that loop,
    so be aware of the rammifications. 
As long as every line in the loop is properly indented, you get to stay 
    in the loop. Once you dedent, you are telling Python to stop the 
    loops instructions there. 

    Avoiding Indentation Errors
Indentation is what Python usesto determine how things are related to 
    the rest of the program. 
If you forget to indent immidiately after a line expecting an indent, 
    you will get an error;  
If you forget to continue to indent lines that are supposed to be in the
    loop, assuming you indented at least one line correctly, you will 
    not get an error, however you *will* get unexpected behaviors; 
    these kinds of errors are called 'Logical Errors'
If you indent when you are not supposed to you will get an 
    'IndentationError'. variable = 1
                            print(variable) <- ERROR
If you indent unnesessarily after the completion of a loop, you will get
    a Logical Error and that (those) line will be included in the loop
    and the consequences of that.     
Try to remember to not forget the colon. Just dont, syntax error and a 
    feeling of sillyness.

    Making Numerical Lists
Lots of reasons to keep a list of numbers in a program, positions,
    status, values. All kinds of reasons. 
range()
for num in range(0,11,1) <- ([index to start on], index to stop at but 
    not include, [amount to increment by]) '[]' are optional
list = range(1,5) will give a list of [1,2,3,4] to 'list'
min(list) = 1
max(list) = 4
sum(list) = 10
List Comprehensions
    I do not understand these totally, however I an not totally sure 
        they are necessary. 
squares = []
for value in range(1, 11):
    squares.append(value**2)

print(squares)

^V^V^V same thing ^V^V^V

squares = [value**2 for value in range(1, 11)]
print(squares)

Instructions:
1 begin with a descriptive name for the list
2 open square brackets [ and define the expression for the values you 
    want to store in the new list
3 then write a for loop to generate the numbers you want to feed in to 
    the expression and then close the square brackets ]

Once writing 3 or 4 line lists become tedious consider giving List
    Comprehensions a serious look. 

    Working with Part of a List
slice! Parts of a list
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
slice_list = list[2:3]
>>> slice_list
[2, 3]
You can work slices a few ways. 
    list[1:6]
    list[:6] or 
    list[5:]

    list[:]

    Tuples
